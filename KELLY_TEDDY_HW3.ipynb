    "My orginial thought was to split up the original function into 3 separate functions, $f_1(x) = x^5$, $f_2(x) = x^2$, and $f_3(x) = -x - 0.2$ and then use Newton's Method to find the roots for each of these three function. However, this did not work because after applying Newton's method on those 3 functions in the same way I did for problem 1, $0$ is the root of both $x^5$ and $x^2$ which is obvious, and then $-0.2$ is the root of $-x-0.2$. However, plugging these values into the full original function does not make the function equal zero for any of them. I deleted the code that I developed for that attempt because it took up lots of space.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll instead now use the full originial function and use Newton's Method to find the 3 roots of the function. We know that the roots of the function are somewhere in the interval $[-500, 500]$. My first thought what to peform the same technique that I used in problem 1, but this time using $500$ as my initial guess. I performed about 40 iterations of Newton's Method with that initial guess and converged on the value of approximately $0.811875$. I then plugged in that value into $f(x)$ and got a value extremely close to zero which allowed me to confirm that this was one of the roots. Then, I proceeded to perform the same process but now with an inital guess of $-500$ since this value is at the complete opposite of the interval. I performed about 40 iterations again and converged on the approximate value $-1.19295$. I plugged this value into $f(x)$ and once again returned a value of practically zero which confirmed that this was the second root. I then thought it would be logical to try $0$ as my thrid initial guess since it perfectly splits the interval in half, although I'm not sure if this was  cheating. Aftering performing Newton's Method once more, I converged on the value $-0.17093$ which I plugged into $f(x)$ and got back the value zero, meaning this was the third root of $f(x)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "I finally figured out how to print out all of the roots of $f(x)$ although it is not very efficient. I first created a list ranging from -500 to 500 with a step of 1. I then iterated through each list element, and for every element in the list `x2`, I initialized a new list `xlist` with the current element being analyzed in `x2` as what my first guess will be. Then, I approximated the root with that value and stored it in `guess` and appended the value of `guess` to the list `x2` and then I passed that new value through `approx_root` until the size of `xlist` exceeded 40. Then I printed out the final approximate after the 40 iterations and then the code moves on to the next element in `x2` and does the same process again. We can see from the output that for all negative initial guesses, it converges on -1.19295, for all positive initial guesses, it convergences on 0.811875, and when the iniitial guess is 0, it converges on -0.17093. I tried to implement a way to stop the loop from iterating if consecutive values were extremely close together but I did not have success implementing that idea into python. Also, I want each root to be printed out only once and not a gazillion times like I have it now, but I still need to figure out how to tranlate that thought into code. I commented the print statements to hide the output because there is so much."

To use `e` in python, you must import the math module which I have done at the top of the notebook. This is my original code below which effectively finds two values that Newton's Method seems to be converging on. These values are approximately $x = -2.9475$ and $x = 1.5052$. I ued the same interval that we were told to use for the previous problem, however notice that I had to adjust the step of the list to be 3 so that the `approx_root3` function would not have to deal with a zero. Otherwise, the derivative would become zero since $e^0-1 = 0$ and this would have resulted in dividing by zero and stopping the code from working. It's surprising to see that newton's Method does not converge on the either of the roots for some of the positive iniital roots. This must have something to do with the exponential function and how the function increases exponentially with increasing positive values, outpacing the quadraftic convergence of Newton's Method. \n",

    "From the graph above, it appears that applying Newton's Method to $f(x) = x^3-3x^2+2x$ with initial values between 1.4 and approximately 1.45 results in converging on the root $x = 1$. There are then a brief set of initial values around 1.45 where using newton's method converges to 2, followed by a brief set of values that converge to 0, followed by a main interval of initial values ranging from about 1.45 to 1.465 which result in converging to the root $x = 2$. After this interval, then the rest of the initial values from about 1.465 to 1.5 converge to the root $x = 0$ when Newton's method is applied. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a really interesting pattern. Why is it that Newton's method converges to 1 with initial guess close to 1.4, and the 2 with initia; guess near the middle of the interval, and then to 0 with initial guess closer to 1.5? Also, why is there that little section in the middle of the interval that converges to 0? I don't have the answer to this question mbut it must have something to do with the properties of the function."
